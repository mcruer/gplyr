\usage{
clipboard_to_list(quote = FALSE, trailing_comma = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{quote}{Logical. Whether to wrap each cell in double quotes. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{trailing_comma}{Logical. Whether to add a trailing comma after the last element. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the formatted text as a character string. The text is also written to the clipboard for easy pasting.
}
\description{
Converts data copied to the clipboard (from Excel or similar sources) into a formatted list suitable for use in R code.
The output is a comma-separated list, optionally quoted, with each element placed on a new line.
The processed list is written back to the clipboard for easy pasting.
}
\details{
The function reads data from the clipboard, splits it into individual elements based on tabs or newlines,
trims whitespace, optionally wraps elements in quotes, and appends commas to each element.
The resulting text is formatted for use in R code and written back to the clipboard for convenience.

This function is particularly useful for preparing column names or values for use in functions like \code{dplyr::select()}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Copy a row or column of data from Excel, then run:
clipboard_to_list()

# Wrap each cell in quotes:
clipboard_to_list(quote = TRUE)

# Skip the trailing comma after the last element:
clipboard_to_list(trailing_comma = FALSE)
}
